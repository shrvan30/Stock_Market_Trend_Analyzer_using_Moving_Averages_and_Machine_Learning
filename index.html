        <h2>What is a Moving Average?</h2>
        <p>A moving average (MA) smooths out price data to identify trends. It helps traders see the overall market direction without short-term price fluctuations.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formula for Standard RSI:</strong><br>
          RSI = 100 − [100 / (1 + RS)]<br>
          Where:<br>
          RS (Relative Strength) = Average Gain / Average Loss over the selected period (usually 14).

        <h2>Types of Moving Average</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Crossover Signals</strong><br>
          Crossovers occur when a shorter-term moving average crosses above or below a longer-term moving average. These events can be important indicators of changing market sentiment.<br><br>
          <strong>a) Bullish Crossover (Golden Cross)</strong><br>
          Signal: This occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average.<br>
          Examples:<br>
          - 100-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average<br>
          - 100-day moving average crossing above the 250-day moving average<br>
          Interpretation: A bullish crossover is considered a positive signal, often indicating the start of an uptrend.<br>
          Type: Bullish<br><br>
          <strong>b) Bearish Crossover (Death Cross)</strong><br>
          Signal: This happens when a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average.<br>
          Examples:<br>
          - 100-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average<br>
          - 100-day moving average crossing below the 250-day moving average<br>
          Interpretation: A bearish crossover is viewed as a negative signal, often suggesting that a downtrend may be starting.<br>
          Type: Bearish<br><br>
          <strong>c) 200-day and 250-day Moving Average Crossover</strong><br>
          Signal: A crossover between the 200-day and 250-day moving averages is rarer, but it can still indicate a long-term trend shift.<br>
          Interpretation: If the 200-day moving average crosses above the 250-day moving average, it suggests increasing bullish momentum. Conversely, if the 200-day crosses below the 250-day, it indicates weakening long-term price trends and the possibility of a downtrend.<br>
          Type: Long-term Trend Shift<br><br>
          <strong>2. Support and Resistance Signals</strong><br>
          Moving averages, especially the 200-day and 250-day, often serve as dynamic support and resistance levels.<br><br>
          <strong>a) Price Bouncing off Moving Averages (Support or Resistance)</strong><br>
          Signal: If the price is above a moving average and then pulls back to it and bounces higher, this moving average is acting as support. Similarly, if the price is below a moving average and bounces lower after approaching it, the moving average acts as resistance.<br>
          Interpretation: Moving averages, especially the 200-day and 250-day, often act as long-term support or resistance.<br><br>
          <strong>b) Price Breaking Through Moving Averages</strong><br>
          Signal: When the price crosses through a moving average, it is a significant signal. For example, if the price breaks through the 200-day moving average to the downside, it suggests a potential trend reversal or weakening of the current uptrend.<br>
          Interpretation: A breakout above a moving average is a sign of bullish momentum, while a breakdown below a moving average signals bearish momentum.<br><br>
          <strong>3. Trend Confirmation Signals</strong><br>
          The alignment of multiple moving averages can help confirm a trend.<br><br>
          <strong>a) Bullish Trend Confirmation</strong><br>
          Signal: If the 100-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average and the 200-day is above the 250-day moving average, this alignment suggests a strong uptrend.<br>
          Interpretation: This indicates that both short-term and long-term trends are pointing upward, providing strong confirmation that the market is in a bullish phase.<br><br>
          <strong>b) Bearish Trend Confirmation</strong><br>
          Signal: If the 100-day moving average is below the 200-day moving average, and the 200-day is below the 250-day moving average, this alignment indicates a strong downtrend.<br>
          Interpretation: This shows that both short-term and long-term trends are pointing downward, signaling that the market is in a bearish phase.<br><br>
          <strong>4. Divergence and Convergence Signals</strong><br>
          Divergence and convergence between price action and moving averages can give insights into potential reversals or continuation of trends.<br><br>
          <strong>a) Positive Divergence</strong><br>
          Signal: Positive divergence occurs when the price forms lower lows, but the moving average (such as the 100-day or 200-day) forms higher lows.<br>
          Interpretation: This suggests that selling pressure is weakening, and a reversal to the upside could be imminent. It’s a potential signal of a bullish reversal.<br><br>
          <strong>b) Negative Divergence</strong><br>
          Signal: Negative divergence occurs when the price forms higher highs, but the moving average forms lower highs.<br>
          Interpretation: This suggests that upward momentum is slowing down, and a price reversal to the downside could be coming. It’s a potential signal of a bearish reversal.<br><br>
          <strong>5. Moving Average "Flatness" or "Slope"</strong><br>
          The slope and direction of moving averages give an indication of the trend’s strength.<br><br>
          <strong>a) Flat Moving Averages</strong><br>
          Signal: If the moving averages (especially the 100-day, 200-day, or 250-day) become flat, it suggests a lack of trend, which can signal market indecision or consolidation.<br>
          Interpretation: A flat moving average implies that the market is in a period of range-bound trading and may not have a clear direction.<br><br>
          <strong>b) Steeply Rising or Falling Moving Averages</strong><br>
          Signal: If the moving averages are sloping steeply upwards (bullish) or downwards (bearish), this indicates a strong trend.<br>
          Interpretation: A steep upward slope of a moving average signals strong bullish momentum, while a steep downward slope signals strong bearish momentum.<br><br>
          <strong>6. Crossovers with Volume</strong><br>
          Volume can be used to confirm moving average crossovers.<br><br>
          <strong>a) Volume Increase on Bullish Crossover</strong><br>
          Signal: If a bullish crossover (e.g., the 100-day crossing above the 200-day) occurs alongside a significant increase in volume, it indicates strong market conviction behind the uptrend.<br>
          Interpretation: High volume confirms that the crossover is supported by strong market participation, making it a more reliable signal.<br><br>
          <strong>b) Volume Increase on Bearish Crossover</strong><br>
          Signal: A bearish crossover (e.g., the 100-day crossing below the 200-day) with high volume indicates strong conviction behind the downtrend.<br>
          Interpretation: The increased volume confirms that the market is likely to continue its downward movement.

        <h2>What is RSI?</h2>
        <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It helps traders identify overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) conditions.</p>

      <div class="info-box" id="typesOfRsiBox">
        <h2>Types of RSI</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1) Standard RSI (14-period)</strong><br>
          Most commonly used RSI with a 14-period calculation. Good for identifying general trends but may lag in fast-moving markets.<br><br>
          <strong>2) Stochastic RSI (StochRSI)</strong><br>
          Applies the stochastic oscillator formula to RSI values instead of price data. More sensitive to price changes, making it useful for short-term traders.<br>
          Formula: StochRSI = [RSI − Lowest(RSI, n)] / [Highest(RSI, n) − Lowest(RSI, n)]. Ranges between 0 and 1 instead of 0-100.<br><br>
          <strong>3) Connors RSI (CRSI)</strong><br>
          A combination of 3 indicators: Standard RSI (short-term, like 3-period RSI), Streak Length (counts consecutive up/down closes), and Percentage Rank (compares today's price change with previous changes). Helps detect short-term reversals more effectively.<br><br>
          <strong>4) Cutler’s RSI</strong><br>
          Similar to standard RSI but uses Simple Moving Average (SMA) instead of Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Results in slightly different values, but overall, it behaves similarly.<br><br>
          <strong>5) Dynamic RSI</strong><br>
          The RSI period adjusts automatically based on market volatility. When the market is volatile, RSI uses a shorter period for quick reactions. When the market is calm, it uses a longer period to reduce noise.
